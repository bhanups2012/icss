We will have two app 
  ics
  ics-hystrixClient
  
  
  ics -> This is an Primary app which will serve on 8080 port. The will contain "Create a Spring Boot application with JPA that exposes below endpoints:"
  ics-hystrixClient -> This is just Hystrix clinet which will run on port:8090. This is for fulfill the "Implement Hystrix for failure scenarios like DB instance down/ API endpoint times out/ down 
 "
 
 
 
 
 Rate Management system(RMS) in Logistic domain
Brief overview: Logistics company XYZ charges customers for shipping goods. Charges are calculated based on rate amt and surcharge amt

 - Design a table "RATE" with fields in MySQL
                - RateId <Long>, RateDescription <String>, RateEffectiveDate <Date>, RateExpirationDate <Date>, Amount <Integer> 
                - RateId is the primary key
                - All are Not Null fields expect RateDescription

- Create a Spring Boot application with JPA that exposes below endpoints:
                Search Rate:
                                - Call "https://surcharge.free.beeceptor.com/surcharge" to fetch the VAT surcharge 
                                - Search the DB with RateId and fetch the corresponding record
                                - Output all the fields of the Rate table and surcharge details in JSON format
                                - If not found, throw status code 404 and description - "RateId not found in RMS" as response 
                Add Rate
                                - Provide valid data and it should successfully store data in DB
                                - Any runtime exception while saving record, throw status code 500 and description "Internal server error. Please contact admin"
                Update Rate
                                - Provide valid data and it should successfully store data in DB
                                - Any runtime exception while saving record, throw status code 500 and description "Internal server error. Please contact admin"
                Delete Rate
                                - Delete Rate record based on RateId
                                - If not found, throw status code 404 and description - "RateId not found in RMS" as response 

- Write Unit Testing using JUnit & Mockito for controller, service, repository layers (Use H2 DB)

 - Implement Basic authentication/ Oauth2 using Okta (Free Developer account) in Spring Security

- Expose all metrics of Spring Actuator endpoints 
 
 - Implement Hystrix for failure scenarios like DB instance down/ API endpoint times out/ down 
 
 - Configure logback as the logging framework with rollover logic i.e. rollover once log file size is 5MB

Protocol to be used: HTTP/ RESTful
Data interchange format to be used: JSON
